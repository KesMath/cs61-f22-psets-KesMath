CS 61 Problem Set 1
===================

**Fill out both this file and `AUTHORS.md` before submitting.** We grade
anonymously, so put all personally identifying information, including
collaborators and citations, in `AUTHORS.md`.

Grading notes (if any)
----------------------
Due to time contraints of having to continously refactor and break pre-existing tests,
I unfortunately did not complete the assignment; I passed 
all tests from Phases 1 & 2 (except for test27/29)
and a portion of Phase 3 (dealing with invalid and double frees)


Extra credit attempted (if any)
